Quantum Mechanics: Wave-Particle Duality

The fundamental equation of quantum mechanics is the Schrödinger equation:

iℏ ∂/∂t |ψ(t)⟩ = Ĥ |ψ(t)⟩

Where:
- ℏ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π ≈ 1.054571817 × 10⁻³⁴ J⋅s)
- |ψ(t)⟩ represents the quantum state vector
- Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator
- i is the imaginary unit (√-1)

The probability density of finding a particle at position x is given by:
ρ(x,t) = |ψ(x,t)|²

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that:
Δx Δp ≥ ℏ/2

Where Δx is the uncertainty in position and Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.

The wave function for a particle in a 1D infinite square well of width L is:
ψₙ(x) = √(2/L) sin(nπx/L)

With energy eigenvalues:
Eₙ = n²π²ℏ²/(2mL²)

For n = 1, 2, 3, ... (quantum numbers)

The quantum harmonic oscillator has energy levels:
Eₙ = ℏω(n + 1/2)

Where ω is the angular frequency of the classical oscillator.

Bell's Theorem and the CHSH inequality:
|⟨A₁B₁⟩ + ⟨A₁B₂⟩ + ⟨A₂B₁⟩ - ⟨A₂B₂⟩| ≤ 2 (classical)
But quantum mechanics allows violations up to 2√2 ≈ 2.828

The EPR paradox demonstrates quantum entanglement where measuring one particle instantaneously affects its entangled partner, regardless of distance - what Einstein called "spooky action at a distance."
